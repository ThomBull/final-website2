    <p class="center">Balisong pivot contruction plays a crutial role in the performance of your balisong. The cheapest system is the washer system, its very simple. It consists of the blade being squished between two washers by the handle, this system is shown on the left. It's typicaly associated with cheap and bad balisongs but this is not true. Some fantastic washer balisongs are out there, such as the squid industries mako, this balisong runs off washers yet still has great handle play (how muc the handles wiggle verticaly) and holds that tune well, however these are rare and thats why washers have a abd rep, especialy with how common, excelent, and easy the next system is to implement.<br>Shown in the middle image is a bushing system balisong. In the past washers were the msot common but now bushings have taken over. they are the same as a washer except for a steal tube that slips over the male sex bold and goes into the handle. This sleave is ever so slightly thicker than the blade (up to 1/6000 of an inch) this prevents the wahsers from clamping down on to the blade and causing binding and alowing for a stronger and better tune. Bushings are the most popular pivot system due to their great feel, easy maintance once tuned, and their sound (which we will touch on later.) Lastly on the right is a ball bearing system, this is by far the least common system but not becasue its bad, but mroe so because bushings are so good. Ball berings replace the washers with ball berings, this allows the handles to be tightened further than normal and still allow the handles to swing freely. They are uncomon due to their feel. A washer/bushing balisong is controlled due to their smooth but higher friction, a bearing balisong is however extreamly fast due to its low friction on the pivots. This makes the balisong feel very heavy and hard to riqoshe off your hand, many dont like this feel but some love it. Another benifit of berings is their simplicity, other than it being a bering they are just as easy to make as washer balisongs and near guerente a perfect tune out of the box without user intervention (bushings may require the buyer to tune it themselves, but this has become less and less of a problem.) All the systems can be great, but I highly recomend going for a bushing system balisong as your first, they are well liked by all flipers and have gotten very cheap and reliable.</p>

    <!-- Final Line of Text -->
    <p class="center">The contruction of your handle is far less important that the pivot construction but its good to know the very basic termonoligies. The above image shows a sandwish style handle construction. It consists of two or more layers sandwitched togeather to make a handle. This designe was once the most common type but now has been taken over by the type shwon at the bottom. The bottom style is called a chanel handle. A chanel handle is one peice of metal milled out to form a solid single peice for the handle. While that might sound better than sandwich its in practice not. Both are perfectly fine and can result in an incredible balisong both flipping and tune. The only differecne is grip, sandwich typicaly has better grip, however some find it uncomftroble so you may prefer chanel. Chanel is also mroe durable in most cases (not all but most.) Chanel is also easier to maintnace for most people as it acts as once peice when taken apart. For begines I would go witch chanell, its more common and is very durable so you one have to worry about screws coming loose when you drop it. Note: there are dozens of handle construction types but sandwich and chanel are the unbrela styles, they acount for the rest fully, the others are just small variation on the two. People in the comunity will acept chanel or sandwich as a discripion 99% of the time.</p>
